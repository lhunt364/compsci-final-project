{
    //TODO make this class work. (:
    //TODO for starters, a constructor with x, y, angle, and speed should probably be made
    //TODO make an update method that moves the bullet along its path according to its angle and speed.
    //TODO speed will probably just be a constant unless we want different bullet speeds for different guns
    //TODO also it should be able to do different damage depending on the equippedWeapon in Main, so storing that would be good too.
